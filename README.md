# Simple_Cypher
This collection of files will encrypt and decrypt messages using three seperate python files.
The Simple_Cypher_Encrypt file takes a string and an integer which returns an encrypted plain text string.
While the Simple_Cypher_Decrypt file accepts a encrypted phrase and decrypts it using the shifted_value integer.
Currently one must know the output of the encryption phase and it's shift_value to successfully decrypt the original
message. The brute force method will decrypt any encrypted phrase using that uses a Ceasar Cypher.
